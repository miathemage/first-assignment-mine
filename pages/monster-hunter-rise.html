      <p>
        Monster Hunter Rise is an action RPG that will transport players to the
        colorful Kamura Village,
        <br />
        an all-new serene mountain locale that attracts visitors with its unique
        culture and innovative hunting technologies.
        <br />
        After hunters equip their armor and select from one of the various
        weapon types, all-new hunting grounds await,
        <br />
        including the ancient Shrine Ruins and more. As players defeat monsters
        and progress through the game,
        <br />
        items from fallen foes can be used to craft unique weapons and armor
        that will increase their chances of future success and survival.
        <br />
        Hunters can tackle these challenges solo, or with up to three other
        players in local or cooperative online play.
