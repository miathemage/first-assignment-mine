      <h1>Monster Hunter Rise</h1>
      <p>
        Monster Hunter Rise is an action RPG that will transport players to the
        colorful Kamura Village, an all-new serene mountain locale that attracts
        visitors with its unique culture and innovative hunting technologies.
        After hunters equip their armor and select from one of the various
        weapon types, all-new hunting grounds await, including the ancient
        Shrine Ruins and more. As players defeat monsters and progress through
        the game, items from fallen foes can be used to craft unique weapons and
        armor that will increase their chances of future success and survival.
        Hunters can tackle these challenges solo, or with up to three other
        players in local or cooperative online play.
